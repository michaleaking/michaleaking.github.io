Welcome to my research website.  
I study **glaciers**, **ice-ocean interactions**, and **climate feedbacks** in the cryosphere.  
My work combines **field measurements**, **remote sensing**, and **numerical modeling** to understand how ice masses respond to a warming world.

Explore my current projects, publications, and photography from polar fieldwork.
