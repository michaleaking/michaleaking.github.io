I am a researcher focused on understanding the dynamics of ice sheets and glaciers and their role in global climate systems.  
My work integrates satellite imagery, field data, and ice sheet models to understand patterns of evolcing glacial dynamics and projections of future polar change.

### 🧊 Research Interests
- Glacier dynamics and ice sheet mass balance
- Remote sensing and satellite analysis 
- Ice–ocean interactions and mechanisms of short-term to decadal ice flow 
- Integration of observations with ice sheet  

### 🏫 Academic Background
- **Ph.D. in Earth Sciecnes**, [Your University], 2020  
- **M.Sc. in Geography**, [Your University], 2016  
- **B.Sc. in Geography (Climate Science specialization)**, [Your University], 2014
